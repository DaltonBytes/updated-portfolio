# Why I'm Building This Site (and Why My Callsign is Egg)

Hi again! Welcome to my portfolio. I've been wanting to build a site like this for a long time, and it feels great to finally hit _publish_. I've built this site to be a blend of a portfolio, project log, and whatever else I decide to experiment with along the way.

Currently, I am in a **HUGE** transition phase. I've decided to resign my commission as a Naval Officer and take my talents into the civilian sector, specifically aiming to land a Program Manager role in the technology industry. Over the past year, I rediscovered how much I enjoy building things, specifically in the software space. I've found joy in creating tools that make everyday life easier, solve problems, and create fun projects. I decided to build this site to document that journey, share what I am learning, and build in public.

When I disconnect from the matrix, I'm usually doing something that keeps life interesting. Sometimes that means trying out a new restaurant with my wife, and other times it's filming something random for my YouTube channel. I enjoy having a mix of creative outlets and hands-on hobbies, especially ones that keep me active. This has kept me balanced and gives me more stories to tell.

Speaking of stories, here's one I'm sure you had a question about:

## Why "Egg"?

In typical Navy callsign fashion, mine came from a mix of timing, personality, and friends who enjoy keeping you humble. When I showed up to my fleet squadron — this is the operational unit you join after finishing flight school, where you fly real missions across the globe — I was confident and excited, otherwise known as too confident for the new guy. The squadron picked up on it immediately and decided that I needed a callsign to ensure I stayed humble throughout my tour.

That's where the landed on "Egg." Simple, silly, and impossible to take too seriously.

It became the nickname that kept me grounded and fit perfectly into the squadron's sense of humor. With callsigns, once you're given one, it's permanent. So I chose to lean into it! Now my whole brand is egg — flying egg, coding egg, cycling egg, all the eggs! It is now who I am, and I love it.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I'm looking forward to growing into this space and sharing my story. This site marks a new chapter for me, and I'm excited to have you along for the ride.
