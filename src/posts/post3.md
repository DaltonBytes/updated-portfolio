## Getting into software development

I love getting into software. It is fun. Look at this code in rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    println("Hello world!");
}
```

- This code is good
- lots of good code

### Now let's get into JS

```js
function main() {
    console.log("Hello world!");
}
```

#### Now let's make this longer

- I need to make this longer
- so i can see if the page scrolls correctly

```python
def main() {
    print("Hello world!")
}

if __init__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
